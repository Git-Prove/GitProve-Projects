## Project Rejection & Guidelines
**Q: How can a project get rejected?**
A: Projects can be rejected for various reasons, including but not limited to:

* Not aligning with GitProve's values or mission.
* Being too broad or lacking a clear objective.
* Duplicating an existing project without significant differentiation.
* Not adhering to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Git-Prove/GitProve-Projects/blob/f68aa9d522aad555045a027b08a8e9ff066d0d63/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

**Q: What types of projects should be avoided or break the rules of GitProve?**
A: Projects that should be avoided include:

* Projects promoting hate speech, discrimination, or any form of harassment.
* Projects that infringe on copyrights or intellectual property rights.
* Overly commercial projects focused solely on profit without community value.
* Projects that don't have a clear learning or collaborative component.
* Projects that violate any terms of service, especially those of third-party platforms or services.

**Q: I'm unsure if my project aligns with GitProve's guidelines. What should I do?**
A: If in doubt, it's always best to consult with the community. Share your project idea on the GitProve Discussions Board for feedback before submitting it formally. This way, you can gauge its alignment with GitProve's values and make necessary adjustments.

**Q: What if my project gets rejected?**
A: If your project gets rejected, don't be disheartened. Take the feedback provided by the community, refine your idea, and consider resubmitting. Remember, every rejection is an opportunity to learn and improve.

**Q: What if I cannot finish the project on time?**
A: Life happens, and sometimes projects can take longer than anticipated. If you foresee a delay, communicate with your team and the GitProve community. It's possible to request an extension or seek additional collaborators to help. The key is open communication and proactive problem-solving.

## Collaboration

**Q: How do I communicate with my project team?**  
A: While GitProve provides a platform for project collaboration, teams are free to choose their preferred communication tools, be it Discord, Slack, or others. Most project-related discussions also happen on the [GitProve Discussions Board](https://github.com/orgs/Git-Prove/discussions).

**Q: I have a conflict with a team member. How should I handle it?**  
A: Open communication is key. Address the issue directly with the concerned individual. If the conflict persists, consider seeking mediation from a neutral GitProve community member or moderator.

## Feedback & Iteration

**Q: I've received feedback on my project. Do I need to implement all suggestions?**  
A: While feedback is invaluable, not all of it may align with your project's vision or goals. Prioritize feedback based on its relevance, impact, and feasibility.

**Q: How often should I update my project?**  
A: The frequency of updates depends on the nature of the project and the feedback received. However, regular updates, even if minor, can keep your project relevant and in the spotlight.
