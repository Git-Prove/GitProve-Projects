## Project Title

**BookBuddy: Community Book Exchange Platform**

## Project Category

## Project Description

BookBuddy is designed to foster a love for reading and sustainability within communities. The platform will allow users to list books they're willing to lend or give away and to request books from others in their vicinity. This not only promotes recycling and reusing but also helps in building a community of readers who can share reviews, recommendations, and even organize local book club meetings.

## Objective

To develop a platform where users can easily lend, borrow, or exchange books with members of their community, thereby reducing the purchase of new books and promoting a sustainable reading culture.
