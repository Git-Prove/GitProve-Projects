# GitProve: A Community of IT Builders

Welcome to GitProve, where we come together to build, learn, and share. Whether you're a beginner looking to get your feet wet or an expert aiming to share your knowledge, GitProve is the place for you.

## Mission

Our mission is to foster a community of IT enthusiasts who are passionate about building projects, learning from one another, and improving their skills. We believe in open collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the power of constructive feedback.

## How It Works

- **Project Submission**: Members can submit projects as Pull Requests in a markdown file. Each project should include a roadmap plan, description, technologies used, and the team involved.
- **Review**: Projects are reviewed and, if accepted, added to our project gallery.
- **Build**: Once accepted, projects should be completed within a week.
- **Presentation**: Every week, we meet (either online or onsite) to showcase the completed projects, discuss the technologies used, and engage in a Q&A session.

## Guidelines

- Projects should be open-sourced or have a portion that can be presented publicly.
- Respect the time limit. Projects are meant to be concise and achievable within a week.
- Be open to feedback and ready to provide constructive criticism.
- Collaborate, help one another, and most importantly, have fun!
