## Our Mission

At GitProve, our mission is to cultivate a community of IT enthusiasts who are zealous about building projects, learning collectively, and enhancing their skills. We champion the principles of open collaboration, knowledge dissemination, and the transformative power of constructive feedback.

## How GitProve Operates

1. **Project Submission**: Members propose projects via Pull Requests in a markdown format. Proposals should encompass a roadmap, a detailed description, the technologies to be used, and the participating team.
2. **Review Process**: Submitted projects undergo a review. Once approved, they're showcased in our project gallery.
3. **Building Phase**: Approved projects have a week for completion.
4. **Presentation Day**: Every week, we convene‚Äîeither virtually or in-person‚Äîto present the finalized projects, deliberate on the employed technologies, and engage in an interactive Q&A session.

## Core Guidelines

- **Open Source Spirit**: Projects should either be entirely open-sourced or have segments that can be publicly presented.
- **Time Respect**: Adhere to the one-week time frame. Projects should be succinct and feasible within this period.
- **Feedback Culture**: Embrace feedback and be prepared to offer constructive critiques.
- **Collaboration**: Team up, assist peers, and above all, enjoy the process!
